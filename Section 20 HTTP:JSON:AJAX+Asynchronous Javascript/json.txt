JSON: JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data
JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation

Both XML and JSON can be used to retrieve data from a webserver

JSON is more of a standard these days, format looks more like js.
XML is not as efficient.

JSON:
	-Can be read by any language
	-Everything has to be a string wrapped in double quotes
	-You can send JSON through HTTP
		-Google server reads in its own language (JSON parse)
		-Google understands it now, executes what it needs..
		-Modify to JSON, send over wire
		-Web browser changes from JSON to JS
			-JS comes with its own JSON functions
				-JSON.parse()
					var obj = JSON.parse('{"name":"John", "age":30');
				-JSON.stringify()
					var myJSON = JSON.stringify(obj);
