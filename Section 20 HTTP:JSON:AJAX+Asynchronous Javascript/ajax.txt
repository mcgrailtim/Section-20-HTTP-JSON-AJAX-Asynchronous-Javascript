Problem.. you have to reload webpage every time we make then receive request from a server.

What if I told you...
	There was a way to only request certain pieces of the webpage.

AJAX
-Allows you to read from a webserver after the page has loaded
-Update a webpage without reloading
-Send data in the background while the user is intereacting with the website

The New Way: Fetch (still AJAX!)
fetch('/my/url').then(response => {
	console.log(response);
});

-Sites feel more responsive
